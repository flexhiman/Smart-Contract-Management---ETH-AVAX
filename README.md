# Shared Office Booking System

This is a decentralized office booking system built on Ethereum using Solidity and ethers.js. The system allows users to add, book, and return office spaces, while owners can withdraw earnings from bookings. The smart contract facilitates all actions related to booking offices, calculating fees, and managing office availability.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) for Ethereum development
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet installed in your browser

## Project Structure

- `contracts/SharedOfficeBookingSystem.sol`: Smart contract handling office booking logic
- `scripts/deploy.js`: Deployment script for deploying the smart contract
- `pages/index.js`: Frontend logic to interact with the smart contract
- `artifacts/`: Folder generated by Hardhat that contains the contract's ABI and bytecode

## Features

### Smart Contract

- **Add Office**: Office owners can add their office to the platform with a specified price per hour.
- **Book Office**: Users can book an office by specifying its ID and the number of hours they want to book it for.
- **Return Office**: After the booking period, users can return the office, and late fees are calculated if applicable.
- **Withdraw Earnings**: Office owners can withdraw their earnings from bookings.

### Frontend

- **MetaMask Wallet Connection**: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to the platform.
- **Office Management**: Owners can add offices, view their availability, and withdraw earnings.
- **Booking System**: Users can book available offices, return them, and view office details.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

In the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
npm install


  ## Set-up

  Clone the GitHub from the Metacrafter modules.
  Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
   ```bash
  npm i
  ```
  Open two additional terminals in your VS code
  In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
   ```bash
  npx hardhat
   ```
  In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
   ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
  ```
  In the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
